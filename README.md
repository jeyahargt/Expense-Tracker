Random data for payment modes and cashback were generated.

The data was structured into monthly tables.

Database Integration:

Technology Used: MySQL (via pymysql library).

Structure:

Monthly tables were created in the expense_tracker database.

Data insertion was automated with Python scripts.

Visualization:

Framework: Streamlit for interactive dashboards.

Charts:

Bar charts for monthly and category-wise expenses.

Pie chart for payment mode distribution.

Metrics:

Total expenses, cashback earned, daily averages, etc.

Queries and Analysis:

SQL queries were crafted for various insights, such as:

Total expenses.

Monthly and category-wise breakdowns.

Specific patterns (e.g., highest spending day, food expenses).
