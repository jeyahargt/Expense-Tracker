The data was structured into monthly tables.

Database Integration:

Technology Used: MySQL (via pymysql library).

Structure:

Monthly tables were created in the expense_tracker database.

Data insertion was automated with Python scripts.

Visualization:

Framework: Streamlit for interactive dashboards.

Charts:

Bar charts for monthly and category-wise expenses.

Pie chart for payment mode distribution.

Metrics:

Insights of the Project
1. Spending Patterns
Monthly Spending Trends: Users can track their spending trends over the months, observing peaks and troughs in their expenses. For instance, higher expenses may occur during festive seasons or vacations.
Category-Wise Spending: Breakdown of expenses by categories (e.g., Rent, Groceries, Shopping) helps identify areas where users spend the most.

2. Daily and Monthly Analysis
Daily Average Expense: Insights into average daily spending help users monitor their daily financial habits and identify unusually high spending days.
Highest Spending Day in a Month: Identifying the day with the highest spending can help users understand specific events or purchases that impacted their budget.

3. Cashback Earned
Cashback Insights: Summarizing total cashback earned encourages users to adopt cashback-friendly payment methods or categories.

4. Payment Mode Preferences
Analyzing the frequency of payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, Debit Card, Cash) helps users understand their payment habits and manage them better for rewards or debt control.

5. Category-Specific Insights
Food Expenses: Monitoring food expenses separately allows users to control dining and grocery budgets.
Shopping and Entertainment: Monthly breakdown of expenses in unrestricted categories like shopping and entertainment helps users strike a balance between essentials and luxuries.

6. Financial Health Overview
Total Expenses: Displaying total expenses provides an overview of overall financial activity.
Monthly Breakdown: Insights into monthly expenses by category and payment mode highlight potential areas for cost optimization.

7. Data-Driven Decision Making
By visualizing trends and patterns, users can make informed decisions, such as:
Reducing unrestricted spending.
Setting realistic monthly budgets.
Prioritizing spending on essential categories.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Enhanced Data Input:

Enable users to upload their expense data via CSV or Excel files.

Real-Time Analytics:

Incorporate APIs for real-time updates and external data integration.

Budgeting and Forecasting:

Add features to set monthly budgets and predict future expenses based on trends.

User Authentication:

Implement secure login and user-specific dashboards.

Advanced Visualizations:

Add more sophisticated visualizations using Plotly or Altair for deeper insights.

Mobile Application:
